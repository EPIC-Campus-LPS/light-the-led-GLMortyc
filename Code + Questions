Questions

What is the purpose of breadboard?
The purpose of a breadboard is to be a safe place to test our circuits and prototypes before finalizing them
Does the LED orientation matter (cathode & abode)?
If the LED orientation is wrong, then the circuit can break with the LED.
Why do you put a resistor in your circuit?
So the LED wouldn't explode with too much current running through it.
How will a resistor with greater resistance affect the light?
A greater resistance resistor would decrease the light's brightness in theory.
